Goal- With the help of machine learning techniques, we have developed a tool which can help doctors to make better and fast decisions in emergency situations. This tool provides rapid and accurate research papers, articles relevant to the patient by analyzing a patient's history, symptoms and diseases.

Language- Python3
Programming tool- Pycharm
Concepts used- Machine learning, Gensim and NLTK library, Natural language processing, Text summerization, Text rank algorithm

We have 2 python files- 
Summerize.py = It extracts the important words from patient's diagnosis summary and summerizes it. After execution it creates 2 files (keywords.txt and summary.txt) in output folder. You have to create empty Output folder inside folder structure. 
lookup.py = It finds the best relevant article from given no of article. Unzip the article folder, it has 5 research articles published over internet
Medical ontology.csv - It is required for executing lookup.py to decie which research article is most relevant top the patient's summary
Input folder - where we have a patientâ€™s diagnosis summary.
